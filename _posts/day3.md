## Robo’s Birthday 
Robin’s birthday today—woop woop—started with a wet tent, yay! Not due to rain during the night but water condensation. We packed the outer tent separately and left the crazy canoe people to soon meet crazy cows. There was a huge herd of white cows on an even larger field. They lowed loudly to one another while we rode on a cobbled street alongside the field. Cow talk seems to be so loud that I, again, did not realize my mattress slipping on my front wheel. We drove past huge and beautiful manors and through densely forest.

## Waren/Müritz
For lunch, we had fries in Waren/Müritz, which manifested itself as the Lake of Constance of Northern Germany. It is a touristic, but picturesque area and definitely a worth a visit. After half-fried fries, we continued to the next Edeka, had a mango lassi and dried the tent in the hot sun. Robin’s seatpost problem reached its climax today and we had to face a little mental overwhelm. He bought some adhesive tape to stick it to his seatpost inside the frame—to be continued. If people had to deal with the same amount and intensity of incidents every day like they have to while bikepacking, they would probably soon suffer a burnout. 

## Just a Normal Evening
Our route would actually have lead us along a heavily frequented road, so we decided to cycle a nearby gravel path through a beautiful forest. At its end awaited us a large sun flower field. We spent the night on a campsite next to a large lake. There camped many other bikepackers on the tent grass, almost all our age. Unfortunately, there was no restaurant at our campsite, so we had to cycle to the next city to have an expensive veggie burger and beer. The way back to our tent was illuminated by the large full moon.
