Some bikepackers crossed our path but they were mainly retirees seeking adventures in their plentiful free time. We definitely were the youngest cyclists but that was to change in Denmark. Like yesterday, our route brought us along many small lakes and rivers while cycling underneath cooling trees. There were some boaters that drove towards us with one transporting a large, inflatable flamingo on top of his cabin—German bathing fun. The tarmac this day was just marvelous in the beginning, which is why we made it as far as Zehdenick for lunch. We had wraps and frozen cookie dough snacks in front of the local Edeka and discovered a new favorite drink for the road: mango-flavored kefir (mango lassi will do as well). To reach the supermarket, we needed to cycle behind a car with one of the most disgusting sexist labels I have ever read in my whole life. I won’t quote it here but I am over and over deeply upset by where men take the audacity.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/ber-cph/assets/blog/images/day2_flamingo.jpg\" alt=\"flamingo\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/ber-cph/assets/blog/images/day2_bikes.jpg\" alt=\"bikes\"></p>\n<h2>About Toilet Paper and Nazi History</h2>\n<p>Finding public toilets in Germany is one of the greatest challenges while bikepacking. We were unlucky this time and peed open air. A sustainability discussion inflamed afterwards because women are unwilling to transport their used toilet tissue and usually just throw it in nature instead. In my opinion, I just must be given a clean, working and free toilet. I will probably need to find a proper solution for this problem on future bike rides.</p>\n<p>We soon accidently faced the Nazi concentration camp Ravensbrück. Being reminded of this exorbitant crimes of German history always leaves me totally shaken. The contrast could not have been bigger, since only a few meters later the cutest café of our whole trip appeared out of nowhere (https://www.coffee-and-travel.com/). We had coffee, banana bread and a brownie and pedaled the remaining kilometers of stage two.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/ber-cph/assets/blog/images/day2_cafe.jpg\" alt=\"cafe\"></p>\n<h2>North German Cobblestone Love</h2>\n<p>In Großmenow—we interpreted the name as “big oh no”—we crossed the border to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the shitty tarmac began. At some points, I had to choose between cobblestones and sand underground on 25mm tires. What else could a happy road biker wish for? Some street planners thought it a good idea to randomly incorporate hundred meters of cobblestone in the road surface, thanks. This lead to two struggles: 1. Robin’s seatpost slipped even more and he avoided sitting in the saddle altogether. 2. My air mattress, mounted on the handle bar bag, slightly slipped with every vibration and secretly landed on my front wheel. Robin luckily heard the grinding noise, otherwise my mattress could already have passed the second day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/ber-cph/assets/blog/images/day2_cobblestone.jpg\" alt=\"cobblestone\"></p>\n<h2>The Campsite</h2>\n<p>No mattress was harmed and we arrived at our campsite in the evening. This very special campsite was actually not made for bikepackers but for travelers by canoe. We had a weird neighbor informing us about trash panda visits during the night. Thanks to his warnings, we stored our remaining food in the sauna locker. We do not certainly know whether we were visited by a trash panda but he assured us that there was one around our tent at 5 a.m.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/ber-cph/assets/blog/images/day2_tent.jpg\" alt=\"tent\"></p>\n","track":"/assets/blog/track-recordings/BER_CPH_Tag_2.gpx"}},"__N_SSG":true}
