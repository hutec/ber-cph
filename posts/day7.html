<p>I had a little mental struggle yesterday in the evening, because my period was to start in about one week and I therefor had a hard time enjoying the trip for the last two days. Bikepacking distances around 100km 7 days in a row is not easy for nobody, not even trained people like me. And I sometimes underestimate the bodily effort that comes with it. PMS always hits me heavily and its impact is even intensified when riding a bicycle since the body has to deal with two struggles at the same time. I guess that’s just a fact to accept and learn to deal with it.</p>
<h2>Bike Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Besides this distraction, we were really looking forward to Copenhagen and were impatient for finally arriving there. We approached the Danish capital from its south-west. The effects of Copenhagen bicycle infrastructure were to feel already well before. We cycled the day’s 85km almost on perfect bike lanes only. Occasionally, traffic lights forced us to stop around every 20km. We were almost alone on the perfectly tarred streets. For lunch, we went to a shopping center, had couscous salad, blueberry kefir and wraps in its courtyard and wondered what our Airbnb host in Copenhagen would be like.</p>

<h2>Water</h2>
<p>The nearer we came to Copenhagen, the more populated and busy the environment got. All Copenhageners were apparently outside cycling or swimming, just enjoying the weather. It was a Sunday afternoon and the thermometer would soon reach the 30-degree mark. Our route of the day ended in the heart of Copenhagen directly behind its main station (for whatever reason). Our Airbnb was 8km off and we had to kill some time until we could enter it. So we randomly cycled along Copenhagen’s waterfront (it’s almost everywhere in the city) and just watched people bike around the city. Years ago, Copenhagen’s authorities set up a voting to decide whether its inhabitants wanted more water access around the city. Of course they wanted and were thus provided with endless bathing places.</p>

<h2>Flatmates</h2>
<p>Our Airbnb host Alan was a bit weird. We did not get the booked room but his own sleeping room, he never cooked and only ate eggs and chicken—even for breakfast. His daughter, her boyfriend and another guest were around our whole stay but Alan luckily went on holiday to Turkey the next day. We were not allowed to really use the kitchen, since it was forbidden to put something wet or hot on its worktop. We still don’t get why one builds a kitchen out of such materials and pro-actively decided to just move around the city as much as possible to not have to deal with this mess.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done! We strolled through Copenhagen’s neighborhoods with the last rays of sunshine, bought rhubarb-flavored Carlsberg cider and watched the sunset at <em>The Lakes</em>.</p>
<p>I am so in love with this city, I have no words.</p>
