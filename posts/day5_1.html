<p>We got up before 6 a.m. since we had to catch today’s frist ferry in Rostock at 9 a.m. 26km of cycling lay between our Airbnb and the Harbor. German garbage disposal is a world of its own: We had to cycle all around the very small city of Benitz to find the glass recycling. Drinking wine in the evening is not only fateful in the morning because of a hangover but also because of spending lots of time to dispose the bottle. After we got rid of the bottle, we started cycling along a foggy valley—a stunning scenery. We finally enjoyed breakfast at the harbor and cycled to the ferry’s waiting line.</p>
<h2>Different realities of life</h2>
<p>The waiting line next to the bikepackers consisted of trucks from all over Europe. It was not yet 9 a.m. in the morning when the truck drivers had one schnapps after the other. They gathered outside their cars and handed around bottles.
Cyclists were the first ones to hop on the ferry—such things happen to you only when entering Denmark. We had water and so-called <em>Cocio</em> (one of our favorite Danish drinks) on the ferry. <em>Cocio</em> basically is milk with cacao and sugar and therefor perfect when cycling.</p>

<h2>Leaving Hell on a Ferry</h2>
<p>Cycling Rostock was pure pain. We reached the city when everyone commuted on non-existent bicycle infrastructure. Our route crossed dangerous rails, countless traffic lights, poor tarmac, cobblestones and high curbs. There was zero parting pain on our side when the German part of the journey was over.</p>
